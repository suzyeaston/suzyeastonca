            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Suzy Easton</strong>, a 42-year-old, Vancouver-born musician, tech enthusiast, and former professional bassist. My musical journey began with childhood piano lessons, leading to open mic performances in my teens. After studying classical music and recording arts, I joined the psychedelic rock band Seafoam, delved into the punk scene, and eventually played bass for rock band The Smokes/Minto, touring across Canada and recording in Chicago with the legendary Steve Albini (Pixies/Nirvana).</p>
            
            <p>Alongside music, I ventured into technology, building a successful career in IT, QA, WebDev, Software Development and software operations, self-taught, building experience through contracting. It's been awesome, I've worked with companies like Electronic Arts, IBM, Western Forest Products, ADP Canada, Crisis Intervention & Suicide Prevention Centre of BC, WineDirect, and Alida.</p>
            
            <p>My creative pursuits include live video jam sessions, new music releases, and comedic documentary filmmaking about life in Vancouver. I'm also excited to announce my brand-new podcast, <strong>‚ÄúEasy Living with Suzy Easton‚Äù</strong>, where I share stories, insights, and laughter about life in Vancouver.</p>
