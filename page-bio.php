            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Suzy Easton</strong>, a 43-year-old, Vancouver-born musician and creative technologist. I started with piano lessons, jumped into open mics, studied classical music and recording arts, joined the psychedelic rock band Seafoam, and played bass for The Smokes/Minto. We toured across Canada and recorded in Chicago with Steve Albini (Pixies/Nirvana).</p>

            <p>Alongside music, I've built a career in IT Ops, QA, automation, web development, and reliability and software operations. I learned on the job through contracting and shipped work with Electronic Arts, IBM, Western Forest Products, ADP Canada, Crisis Intervention &amp; Suicide Prevention Centre of BC, WineDirect, and Alida.</p>

            <p>Right now I'm building in a few lanes, new music, music lessons and online sessions, and <em>Lousy Outages</em>, an arcade-style outage and status dashboard I'm turning into a product for small companies.</p>
