            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Suzy Easton</strong>, a 42-year-old, Vancouver-born musician, tech enthusiast, and former professional bassist. My musical journey began with childhood piano lessons, leading to open mic performances in my teens. After studying classical music and recording arts, I joined the psychedelic rock band Seafoam, delved into the punk scene, and eventually played bass for rock band The Smokes/Minto, touring across Canada and recording in Chicago with the legendary Steve Albini (Pixies/Nirvana).</p>
            
            <p>Alongside music, I ventured into technology, building a successful career in IT, QA, WebDev, Software Development and software operations, self-taught, building experience through contracting. It's been awesome, I've worked with companies like Electronic Arts, IBM, Western Forest Products, ADP Canada, Crisis Intervention & Suicide Prevention Centre of BC, WineDirect, and Alida.</p>
            
            <p>My creative pursuits include live video jam sessions, new music releases, and comedic documentary filmmaking about life in Vancouver. Lately I'm focused on writing album reviews of classic jazz and rock records I uncovered while working at HMV (2007&ndash;2012, Burrard &amp; Robson). After the single <em>A Little Louder</em> aired on CiTR, I'm shifting toward producing a series of hard rock demos. CiTR even spun my electronica track <em>Obsolete</em> again &mdash; it's not my favourite anymore, but I love CiTR!</p>
