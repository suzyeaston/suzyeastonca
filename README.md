## Track Analyzer
Uploads are sent to OpenAI's Whisper and GPT‑4 APIs for a quick analysis of your
MP3. Results appear with a fun retro overlay and clear loading indicators. For
production use, consider exposing this feature through a custom REST endpoint
and caching results in case OpenAI is unavailable.
