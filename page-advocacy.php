        <p>I regularly work with residents of the Downtown Eastside to address housing and overdose issues. My current focus is organizing tenant committees and connecting people with city services.</p>
        <p>I'm also exploring a 2026 run for Vancouver City Council, centering affordable housing and harm reduction.</p>
