        <h1>Coffee for Builders (Vancouver)</h1>
        <p>(plus sports takes, riffs, and general civic chaos)</p>

        <p>I’m Suzy — Vancouver-born engineer + musician. I’ve toured as a bassist, recorded in Chicago with Steve Albini, and now I work in the world of identity/cloud/automation/QA/WordPress/DevOps-ish reliability stuff.</p>
        <p>This page is simple: I want to meet more people outside my existing sphere — folks building things (tech, music, creative projects, startups, community work)… and yes, I also love sports, so I’m never mad if the conversation detours into Canucks pain, NFL picks, or “why did the coach do that?!”</p>

        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>A low-key coffee chat with a stranger who builds things. No networking theatre. No “let’s circle back.” Just a human conversation.</p>

        <h2>What we can talk about</h2>
        <p>Pick your own adventure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipping software, automating boring stuff, keeping systems from melting</li>
            <li>Music-making, recording, songwriting, gear rabbit holes</li>
            <li>Side projects (I run a little lab on my site — outage dashboards, audio tools, etc.)</li>
            <li>Vancouver civic stuff (tenant advocacy / city decisions / local weirdness)</li>
            <li>Sports: NHL/NFL/NBA hot takes, analytics, pools, “capper logic,” whatever</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>30–45 minutes</li>
            <li>Public spot (coffee shop / lobby / busy place)</li>
            <li>Vancouver proper (I’m not commuting to Mars, sorry)</li>
            <li>If we vibe, we can do it again. If not, we had a nice coffee and return to our respective caves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The only rule</h2>
        <p>Bring one thing you’re excited about right now — a project, a question, a plan, a weird obsession. Curiosity required.</p>

        <h2>How to say hi</h2>
        <p>Send me a message with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What you’re building (or learning)</li>
            <li>A song you’ve had on repeat</li>
            <li>Your ideal low-key Vancouver hang</li>
            <li>And if you’re a sports nerd: your team + your most controversial take</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>One tweak I strongly recommend (because it’ll pull better dudes):</strong><br>
        Subject: Coffee for Builders — [their project]. Lazy guys won’t do it. Good.</p>

        <h2>Small print (aka the adult section)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>First meet is public. Always.</li>
            <li>No pitches for crypto casinos, “marketing partnerships,” or “let me 10x your SEO.”</li>
            <li>If you’re reading this as a single person: cool — I’m not allergic to romance — but I’m starting with coffee + conversation like a functioning grown-up.</li>
        </ul>
