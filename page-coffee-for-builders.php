        <h1>Coffee for Builders (Vancouver)</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">(plus sports takes, riffs, and a little civic chaos)</p>

        <p>I’m Suzy, Vancouver-born engineer + musician. I came up through classical music and recording arts, toured for years as a bassist, and recorded in Chicago with Steve Albini. These days I build and run things in the identity/cloud/automation/QA/WordPress/DevOps-ish reliability universe — the unglamorous but sacred art of making systems behave.</p>
        <p>Outside work, I run a small lab on this site: tools like Lousy Outages (a retro outage dashboard to keep third-party providers honest) and an audio analysis tool for musicians using OpenAI/Whisper (hah thats a work in progress). I also still write, record, and release music.</p>
        <p>This page is my “meet humans on purpose” experiment, because Vancouver can be a small town socially, and I’m not here to only meet people who already look like my existing circles.</p>

        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>A low-key coffee chat with someone who’s building something, ie - tech, music, art, startups, community work, whatever. No networking theatre. No “let’s circle back.” Just a real conversation.</p>

        <h2>What we can talk about</h2>
        <p>Pick your own adventure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipping software, automation, incident response, reliability, weird bugs</li>
            <li>Identity/SSO/SCIM, cloud stuff, testing, CI/CD, “why is this broken at 2am”</li>
            <li>Recording, songwriting, gear rabbit holes, creative process</li>
            <li>Side projects, entrepreneurship, maker nonsense</li>
            <li>Vancouver civic stuff (advocacy / city decisions / local weirdness)</li>
            <li>Sports: NHL/NFL/NBA hot takes, analytics, pools, “capper logic,” etc </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>30–45 minutes</li>
            <li>Public spot (coffee shop / lobby / busy place)</li>
            <li>Vancouver proper, or Victoria but that means I have to commute </li>
            <li>If things go well, we can do it again. If not, we had a decent coffee and return to our respective caves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The only rule</h2>
        <p>Bring one thing you’re excited about right now, a project, a question, a plan, a weird obsession. Curiosity required.</p>

        <h2>How to say hi</h2>
        <p>Send me a message with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What you’re building (or learning)</li>
            <li>A song you’ve had on repeat</li>
            <li>Your ideal low-key Vancouver hang</li>
            <li>And if you’re a sports nerd: your team + your most controversial take</li>
        </ul>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Subject line = <em>Coffee for Builders — [your project]</em>. It helps me spot the good stuff fast.</p>

        <h2>Small print (aka the adult section)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>First meet is public. Always.</li>
            <li>No pitches for crypto casinos, “marketing partnerships,” or “let me 10x your SEO.”</li>
        </ul>
