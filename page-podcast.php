            <p>
                Welcome, brave traveler of the internet, to Easy Living with Suzy Easton. 
                I’m Suzy: Vancouver-born musician, tech pro, occasional troublemaker, and full-time cheese enthusiast.
            </p>

            <p>
                I use to rock out on bass across Canada, recording in Chicago with legendary producer Steve Albini, nearly froze my fingers off on 
                Prairie tours, and popped up on MuchMusic (when that was still a thing). Now, I work in tech.
            </p>

                In “Easy Living with Suzy Easton,” I share comedic stories about navigating Vancouver’s weird and wonderful 
                quirks, plus behind-the-scenes glimpses of my musical adventures.
            </p>
